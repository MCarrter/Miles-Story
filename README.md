# Miles-Story
A really cool true story about Miles
I made a story for Creative Writing with my imagination.
My first draft was not too good, so I worked on it more.
I then learned more about world-building thanks to some tutoring.
I then used this knowledge to sharpen my writing and make the story enjoyable.
Everyone loved my story. The End.
